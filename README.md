# TensorFlow Lite Image Classification App

## Description

The TensorFlow Lite Image Classification App is an Android application that utilizes TensorFlow Lite, a lightweight solution for mobile and embedded devices, to perform image classification. The app allows users to either take a photo using their device's camera or select an image from their gallery. Once an image is captured or selected, the app processes the image using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to classify the object in the image.

The app supports classification of a predefined set of classes, such as "Banana," "Orange," "Pen," and "Sticky Notes." After classification, it displays the identified class along with the confidence levels for each class.

## Features

- **Camera Integration**: Users can take a photo directly from the app using their device's camera.
- **Gallery Access**: Users can select an existing image from their device's gallery.
- **Image Classification**: The app classifies the image and displays the most likely object class along with confidence scores for each possible class.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions and results display.

## How to Run the App

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio installed on your computer.
- An Android device or emulator for testing.
